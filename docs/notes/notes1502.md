Date:  15.02

Chairman: Duco
Notetaker: Paulina

Backlog Feedback

- detailed stuff (e.g. “user must be able to answer a question”, “the host can do *something specific*”, etc.)
- put “user” (roles) in sentences (instead of “add questions” do “user can add questions”)
- change would -> could/should
- differentiate between functional and non-functional requirements

Quiz Questions
submission - to be decided (they will announce it)

	From Q&A:
	- randomized
	- multiple choice
	- we can add something that we want, something creative (features, question types)
	- they would appreciate questions with images!!

Scrum

- everyone has to watch the video
- every week someone takes 1 issue (whatever we can finish in one week, then put a merge request); then a meeting, discuss what you did last week, plus plan the next week
should start in week 3 (when we start the coding part)

GUI

- first design it, then start implementing
- can use lucid charts for this
- later -> peer evaluation (with other oopp groups)

Code of Conduct

- semi-serious; just what the group agrees on
- discussion on code style<3 -> put it in the XML file
	-> but we need(!) comments and java doc

***Other frameworks: not really allowed, we should use what they gave us

Tasks For Next Week:

Duuk will send us the specific list

END OF THIS WEEK:
Code of Conduct
Backlog
Teamwork assignment 2B
everyone should have made a merge request and have it approved by next Friday (25.02) -> could be sth easy, mainly to check that we get it

Our next meeting:
This Wednesday (16.02), 19.00
